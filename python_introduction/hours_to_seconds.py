# This lines of codes converts hours to seconds

# The number of hours to convert is assigned to be 2
hours = 2

# There are 60 seconds in 1 minutes, and since 60 minutes makes 1 hour, 60 seconds times 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds in an hour.

# For 2 hours, it is calculated thus:

seconds = hours*3600

print(f"2 hour(s) is {seconds} seconds.")
